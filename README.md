# 🚀 AstraGrid AI

### Air-Gapped Predictive Copilot for Secure MPLS Operations

AstraGrid AI is an offline AI-powered network operations assistant designed for secure and mission-critical environments. The system analyzes network telemetry, detects anomalies, predicts failures using Machine Learning, and provides root-cause analysis with corrective actions through a locally hosted Phi-3 model.

> No Internet Required • Fully Air-Gapped • Local AI Inference • Real-Time Monitoring

## 📊 Dataset Generation

Generate a synthetic sequential dataset of 2,000 network telemetry records:

```bash
python ml/generate_time_series.py
```

---

## 🧠 Model Training

Train the prediction model:

```bash
python ml/train_model.py
```

This creates:

```text
This creates:

models/lstm_model.keras
models/scaler.pkl
models/label_encoder.pkl
```
The LSTM uses the latest 10 telemetry readings to predict normal, risk, or failure.
